**ActiveForms** is a DoD PDF forms parser built with R, Shiny, and Electron intended for Systems Administrators to easily apply configuration to networked devices
where manually reading forms would take *too much* time. For example, SAAR (DD 2875) forms for authorization of user accounts in Active Directory.

## Installation

You can install the developmental version of ActiveForms using `remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("program--/ActiveForms")
```

## Example

ActiveForms can be run by either the `Electron`-built desktop application or as a web service.
To run the web service, simply install ActiveForms and then call:

``` r
ActiveForms::run_app()
```
